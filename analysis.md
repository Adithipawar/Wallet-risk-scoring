# Wallet Risk Scoring: Technical Analysis & Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the Wallet Risk Scoring System, detailing the data collection methods, feature engineering, scoring algorithms, and risk assessment logic used to evaluate Ethereum wallet creditworthiness for DeFi lending protocols.

## Data Collection Method

### Primary Data Sources

#### 1. Etherscan API Integration
```python
# Real-time blockchain data collection
- Wallet balance queries
- Transaction history retrieval  
- Contract interaction analysis
- Gas usage patterns
```

**Data Points Collected:**
- ETH balance (current)
- Total transaction count
- Transaction history (last 100 transactions)
- Contract interactions
- Transaction success/failure rates
- Gas usage patterns
- Timestamp analysis

#### 2. Protocol-Specific Analysis
```python
compound_addresses = {
    'cETH': '0x4ddc2d193948926d02f9b1fe9e1daa0718270ed5',
    'cUSDC': '0x39aa39c021dfbae8fac545936693ac917d5e7563',
    # ... additional protocol addresses
}
```

### Data Quality Assurance

#### Validation Pipeline
1. **Address Validation**: Ethereum address format verification
2. **API Response Validation**: Status code and data integrity checks
3. **Transaction Classification**: Automated protocol detection
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Timestamp validation and chronological ordering

#### Fallback Mechanisms
```python
def _generate_realistic_mock_data(self, wallet_address: str):
    """
    Deterministic mock data generation for API failures
    - Persona-based transaction patterns
    - Realistic value distributions
    - Consistent risk profiles
    """
```

## Feature Engineering & Selection

### Core Feature Categories

#### 1. **Transaction Volume Metrics**
```python
# Volume-based features
total_volume_eth = sum(transaction_values)
avg_tx_value_eth = np.mean(transaction_values)
max_tx_value_eth = max(transaction_values)
volume_volatility = np.std(transaction_values)
```

**Rationale**: Transaction volume patterns indicate wallet sophistication, risk tolerance, and potential collateral capacity.

#### 2. **Activity & Engagement Features**
```python
# Engagement scoring
compound_ratio = compound_transactions / total_transactions
defi_ratio = defi_transactions / total_transactions
engagement_score = (compound_txs + defi_txs) / total_transactions
```

**Rationale**: Higher DeFi engagement correlates with protocol familiarity and reduced default risk.

#### 3. **Temporal Behavior Analysis**
```python
# Time-based risk indicators
days_since_last_tx = (now - last_transaction_time).days
avg_monthly_frequency = total_transactions / account_age_months
activity_decline = 1 - (recent_30d_txs / historical_avg)
```

**Rationale**: Recent activity patterns predict future engagement and position management capability.

#### 4. **Risk Concentration Metrics**
```python
# Concentration risk assessment
volume_concentration = max_tx_value / total_volume
large_tx_ratio = large_transactions_count / total_transactions
portfolio_diversification = unique_protocols_used / total_protocols
```

**Rationale**: Concentrated positions indicate higher risk exposure and potential liquidity constraints.

### Feature Normalization Strategy

#### Min-Max Scaling with Domain Knowledge
```python
def normalize_feature(value, min_threshold, max_threshold):
    """
    Domain-aware normalization preserving business logic
    """
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, (value - min_threshold) / (max_threshold - min_threshold)))
```

#### Logarithmic Transformation for Skewed Distributions
```python
# Handle extreme values in transaction amounts
normalized_volume = np.log1p(transaction_volume) / np.log1p(max_expected_volume)
```

## Risk Scoring Architecture

### Six-Component Risk Model

#### 1. **Liquidation Risk (25% weight)**
```python
liquidation_risk = min(1.0,
    0.3 * (1 - success_rate) +           # Transaction failure rate
    0.3 * min(1.0, days_inactive / 90) + # Recent inactivity penalty
    0.2 * (1 - engagement_score) +       # Low DeFi engagement penalty
    0.2 * activity_decline               # Declining activity penalty
)
```

**Justification**: Measures ability to manage positions and avoid forced liquidations through active monitoring and position adjustment.

#### 2. **Volatility Risk (20% weight)**
```python
volume_volatility_norm = volume_volatility / max(avg_tx_value, 0.01)
volatility_risk = min(1.0,
    0.4 * min(1.0, volume_volatility_norm) +  # Transaction value variance
    0.3 * large_tx_ratio +                    # Large transaction frequency
    0.3 * (1 - min(1.0, tx_count / 50))      # Insufficient data penalty
)
```

**Justification**: High transaction volatility indicates unpredictable behavior patterns that correlate with default risk.

#### 3. **Concentration Risk (15% weight)**
```python
concentration_risk = min(1.0,
    0.5 * volume_concentration +           # Single transaction dominance
    0.3 * (1 - engagement_score) +        # Protocol concentration
    0.2 * (1 - min(1.0, tx_count / 30))   # Activity concentration
)
```

**Justification**: Concentrated exposure increases vulnerability to market shocks and reduces diversification benefits.

#### 4. **Activity Risk (15% weight)**
```python
activity_risk = min(1.0,
    0.4 * min(1.0, days_since_last_tx / 60) +     # Recent inactivity
    0.3 * (1 - min(1.0, monthly_frequency / 5)) + # Low activity frequency
    0.3 * activity_decline                         # Declining engagement
)
```

**Justification**: Active users demonstrate ongoing engagement and ability to manage positions effectively.

#### 5. **Leverage Risk (15% weight)**
```python
leverage_risk = min(1.0,
    0.4 * large_tx_ratio +                              # Large position indicators
    0.3 * (1 - defi_ratio) +                           # Non-DeFi activity penalty
    0.3 * min(1.0, max_tx / max(avg_tx * 5, 0.1))      # Position size concentration
)
```

**Justification**: Large transactions relative to normal activity suggest leveraged positions with higher risk profiles.

#### 6. **Liquidity Risk (10% weight)**
```python
liquidity_risk = min(1.0,
    0.3 * (1 - min(1.0, total_volume / 5)) +        # Volume-based liquidity
    0.3 * min(1.0, days_since_last_tx / 45) +       # Recent activity liquidity
    0.2 * (failed_txs / max(total_txs, 1)) +        # Failed transaction penalty
    0.2 * (1 - min(1.0, eth_balance / 0.1))         # Balance-based liquidity
)
```

**Justification**: Liquidity constraints prevent effective position management and increase default probability.

### Composite Score Calculation

#### Weighted Risk Aggregation
```python
def calculate_composite_score(risk_components, features):
    weighted_score = sum(
        risk_components[component] * self.risk_weights[component]
        for component in risk_components
    )
    
    # Apply wallet-specific modifiers
    if not features['is_active_wallet']:
        # Inactive wallets: 200-700 range
        scaled_score = 200 + (weighted_score * 500)
    else:
        # Active wallets: Full 0-1000 range with bonuses
        engagement_bonus = features['engagement_score'] * 100
        maturity_bonus = features['wallet_maturity'] * 50
        scaled_score = (weighted_score * 800) + 100 - engagement_bonus - maturity_bonus
    
    return max(0, min(1000, scaled_score))
```

## Inactive Wallet Handling

### Specialized Risk Assessment

#### Wallet Classification System
```python
def classify_inactive_wallet(eth_balance, tx_count):
    if tx_count == 0 and eth_balance == 0:
        return 'unused'          # Risk modifier: 0.3
    elif tx_count == 0 and eth_balance > 0:
        return 'funded_inactive' # Risk modifier: 0.6
    elif tx_count > 0 and eth_balance == 0:
        return 'depleted'        # Risk modifier: 0.8
    else:
        return 'low_activity'    # Risk modifier: 0.5
```

#### Differentiated Risk Scoring
- **Unused Wallets**: Lower risk due to unknown behavior (200-400 range)
- **Funded Inactive**: Medium risk with balance consideration (300-600 range)
- **Depleted Wallets**: Higher risk indicating potential distress (400-700 range)
- **Low Activity**: Moderate risk requiring monitoring (250-550 range)

## Model Validation & Performance

### Validation Methodology

#### 1. **Cross-Validation Framework**
```python
# Persona-based validation
personas = ['inactive', 'new_user', 'casual_defi', 'active_trader', 'defi_native', 'whale']
for persona in personas:
    validate_risk_distribution(persona)
```

#### 2. **Score Distribution Analysis**
- **Active Wallets**: Full 0-1000 range utilization
- **Inactive Wallets**: Constrained 200-700 range
- **Category Distribution**: Balanced across risk levels

#### 3. **Consistency Checks**
```python
# Deterministic scoring validation
np.random.seed(int(wallet_address[-8:], 16) % (2**32))
assert score_1 == score_2  # Same address = same score
```

### Performance Metrics

#### Processing Efficiency
- **Throughput**: 1.5-2 wallets per second
